This is a template for Spark! DS 519 projects. It has pre-configured eslint.config.mjs - ([`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/)) and .prettierrc - ([`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/)) to reflect industry standard development guidelines.

## Setting Up Your Developer Experience

To get the most out of ESLint and Prettier, It is recommended to make the changes to you IDE:

#### Add this code to your _.vscode/settings.json_

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
}
```

#### Download these VSCode extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Getting Started

This template uses Next.js. If you havent used Next before or need more information, take a look here:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. Do not use Microsoft Edge 🤮

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Adding Additional Tech

Most projects will require the use of other technologies. Below are a few guides and recommedations for integrating commonly used software into your Next.js project.

- [Next.js Setup w/ Prisma](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-next-js-prisma-setup)
- [Emotion & Next.js](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/implementing-nextjs-emotions-in-your-project) - Emotion is the default CSS-in JS library for all new Spark! projects. Use Emotion instead of styled-components, as styled-components is not as easily compatible with Server Side Rendering, or Typed CSS variables. Emotion is also more readily compatible with a wide array of component libraries.
- [Clerk Setup w/ Next.js](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) - Clerk will be the default user authentication software for all new Spark! projects. Please reach out to Omar for creating and retrieving API keys for your project. Do NOT use firebase/auth even if your project uses Firestore.
- #### Component Libraries
  - All new projects will be required to use a [design system](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/) You will receive designs from your DS488 design team which will utilize a design kit. Use the corresponding component library to implement those designs on the front end of your project.

    "What do you consider to be the biggest barrier your organization faces in serving LGBTQIA2S+ residents?": "Transportation and access. Our programs are welcoming to all students across Boston and in the MetroWest areas, but students routinely struggle to reach our in-person locations for programming during the summer. Similarly, our staff have difficulty commuting to our locations outside of the city due to poor transportation infrastructure. The ability to have a centralized bus or transportation method is crucial to us.",
    "\nWhat gaps in services have you identified for LGBTQIA2S+ residents in Boston?": "For our LGBTQIA2S+ students, the biggest gap is in opportunities to see their lived experiences affirmed and reflected in the educational space. We enable these students to create innovative projects the help them give back to their community without sacrificing how their results represent their identities. For our LGBTQIA2S+ staff, the biggest gap is in the ability to serve as role models for youth that are struggling with the same notions of self-love and self-advancement that they share. ",

We are not merely a celebration, we are speaking up and fighting back to demand a better society.\n\nOur top priority is to provide a dynamic and welcoming space for participants of all sexualities, genders, races, ages, ethnicities, sizes, economic backgrounds, and physical abilities.
